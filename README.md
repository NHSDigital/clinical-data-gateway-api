# Clinical Data Gateway API

[![CI/CD Pull Request](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/repository-template/actions/workflows/cicd-1-pull-request.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/repository-template/actions/workflows/cicd-1-pull-request.yaml)
[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=repository-template&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=repository-template)

Repository housing all code responsible for handling the Clinical Data Gateway APIs. This repository houses the various Python modules responsible for managing logic within the APIs, as well as all the Terraform code responsible for deploying the APIs within an environment.

The Clinical Data Gateway APIs look to provide the [GP Connect](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/gp-connect) APIs over the internet, via the [API Management platform](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/api-platform). More details on the GP Connect specifications can be found on the [GP connect specifications for developers](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/gp-connect/develop-gp-connect-services/specifications-for-developers) page.

## Setup

Clone the repository.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:NHSDigital/clinical-data-gateway-api.git
cd clinical-data-gateway-api.git
```

The project can then be built with `make`, initially via the `env` target. All dependencies for the project will be installed within a Docker container, ensuring a consistent build environment across all developers' machines. This container is named `gateway-build-container` and is built automatically via the `env` target.

```shell
make env
```

> [!NOTE]<br>
> If any additional certificates need to be trusted when building locally, these can be added to the `infrastructure/images/build-container/resources/dev-certificates` directory. These certificates will then automatically be trusted by the build container.

Once the build container has been created, you can either connect to it from within vscode via the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers), or connect to it via the command line via the `bash` make target.

```shell
make bash
```

### Prerequisites

The following software packages, or their equivalents, are expected to be installed and configured:

- [Podman](https://podman.io/) container runtime,
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 3.82 or later,

> [!NOTE]<br>
> The version of GNU make available by default on macOS is earlier than 3.82. You will need to upgrade it or certain `make` tasks will fail. On macOS, you will need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, then to install `make`, like so:
>
> ```shell
> brew install make
> ```
>
> You will then see instructions to fix your [`$PATH`](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_path.tmpl) variable to make the newly installed version available. If you are using [dotfiles](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles), this is all done for you.

- [GNU sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) and [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) are required for the scripted command-line output processing,
- [GNU coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) and [GNU binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) may be required to build dependencies like Python, which may need to be compiled during installation,

> [!NOTE]<br>
> For macOS users, installation of the GNU toolchain has been scripted and automated as part of the `dotfiles` project. Please see this [script](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles/blob/main/assets/20-install-base-packages.macos.sh) for details.

### Configuration

Installation and configuration of the toolchain dependencies is completed as part of building the build container via the `make env` command above.

## Usage

Once the build container has been build and is up and running. A few different make targets are provided for installing dependencies and building the codebase.

- `dependencies` - installs all dependencies required for the project
- `build` - builds the codebase so that it is ready for deployment
- `clean` - stops and destroys a built build container
- `pre-commit` - runs all pre-commit hooks against the codebase, including linting and formatting checks

### Testing

There are `make` tasks for you to configure to run your tests.  Run `make test` to see how they work.  You should be able to use the same entry points for local development as in your CI pipeline.

#### Continous Integration

More documentation on the GitHub actions utilised to support continuous integration can be found on the [Continuous Integration](./.github/github_actions.md) page.

## Design

### Diagrams

The [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) is a simple and intuitive way to create software architecture diagrams that are clear, consistent, scalable and most importantly collaborative. This should result in documenting all the system interfaces, external dependencies and integration points.

![Repository Template](./docs/diagrams/Repository_Template_GitHub_Generic.png)

The source for diagrams should be in Git for change control and review purposes. Recommendations are [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) (example above in [docs](.docs/diagrams/) folder) and [Mermaids](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid). Here is an example Mermaids sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>+Service: GET /users?params=...
    Service->>Service: auth request
    Service->>Database: get all users
    Database-->>Service: list of users
    Service->>Service: filter users
    Service-->>-User: list[User]
```

### Modularity

Most of the projects are built with customisability and extendability in mind. At a minimum, this can be achieved by implementing service level configuration options and settings. The intention of this section is to show how this can be used. If the system processes data, you could mention here for example how the input is prepared for testing - anonymised, synthetic or live data.

## Contributing

Describe or link templates on how to raise an issue, feature request or make a contribution to the codebase. Reference the other documentation files, like

- Environment setup for contribution, i.e. `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Coding standards, branching, linting, practices for development and testing
- Release process, versioning, changelog
- Backlog, board, roadmap, ways of working
- High-level requirements, guiding principles, decision records, etc.

## Contacts

Provide a way to contact the owners of this project. It can be a team, an individual or information on the means of getting in touch via active communication channels, e.g. opening a GitHub discussion, raising an issue, etc.
